# CoolerMasterHappyBirthday
Prints the message "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" on the NUMPAD of a Cooler Master MasterMeys Pro M. To use this code for other keyboards, change the keyboard in main(): "SetControlDevice(DEV_MKeys_M_White);"

Note: The supporting files are for 64 bit. For 32 bit, you may need to replace some of the files

To utilize this, make a new Visual Studio C++ project, and add the files in this repo as existing items. Then, change the project to a 64 bit project by going to Build --> Configuration Manager --> Active solution platform --> x64.
